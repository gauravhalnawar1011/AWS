# AWS Load Balancers Overview

Load balancers play a pivotal role in distributed computing systems, efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to enhance performance, reliability, and scalability. In the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem, three main types of load balancers are available, each catering to specific use cases.

## 1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

- **Type:** Traditional load balancer by AWS.
- **Layer:** Operates at both the application and transport layers.
- **Protocols:** Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- **Features:** Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances, capable of routing at both the application and transport layers. Ideal for applications built within the EC2-Classic network.

## 2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Type:** Advanced and flexible load balancer.
- **Layer:** Works specifically at the application layer.
- **Protocols:** Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.
- **Features:** Designed for content-based routing, enabling sophisticated configurations. Ideal for modern, containerized applications, and microservices.

## 3. Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- **Type:** Tailored for handling TCP, UDP, and TCP/UDP traffic.
- **Layer:** Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4).
- **Protocols:** Supports TCP, UDP, and TLS (secure TCP).
- **Features:** Provides high-performance, low-latency balancing. Suited for scenarios requiring extreme performance and static IP addresses.

## 4. Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)

- **Type:** Specifically designed for handling UDP traffic.
- **Layer:** Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4).
- **Protocols:** Supports UDP.
- **Features:** Tailored for use cases like IoT (Internet of Things) and gaming applications, where managing a large number of concurrent connections is crucial.

## Considerations

- **Use Case:** Choose the load balancer type based on your specific use case, such as web applications, microservices, or handling different types of traffic.
  
- **Features:** Consider the features provided by each load balancer type, such as content-based routing, WebSocket support, or high-performance requirements.

- **Scalability:** Ensure that the chosen load balancer type can scale to meet the demands of your application.

It's imperative to make a thoughtful selection of the appropriate load balancer type based on your application's unique requirements, as each type has distinct strengths and is optimized for different scenarios within the AWS environment.

## Setting Up Load Balancer

The process to set up a load balancer in AWS typically involves the following steps:

1. Create a security group with the required protocols, such as SSH and HTTP.
2. Launch one or more EC2 instances that host your web applications.
3. Configure user data scripts to install web servers (e.g., Apache HTTP Server) and host your applications.
4. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and attach the EC2 instances to a target group.
5. Configure routing in the ALB to route incoming requests to the appropriate target group based on URLs or query strings.
6. ## Process to Setup Load Balancer

This section outlines the step-by-step process to set up a load balancer in your Amazon EC2 environment.

### Step 1: Create Security Group

Create a security group with the following protocols in the inbound rules:

- SSH (Port 22) for remote access.
- HTTP (Port 80) for web traffic.

Use a security group name, such as `ashokit_Security_group`.

### Step 2: Launch EC2 Instances

1. Launch your first Amazon EC2 instance (EC2-1) and host a web application. Configure the instance with a user data script to install a web server (e.g., Apache) and serve a simple web page. The user data script could look like this:

    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    sudo su
    yum install httpd -y
    cd /var/www/html
    echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
    service httpd start
    ```

2. Launch your second Amazon EC2 instance (EC2-2) and host a web application. Configure this instance in a similar way as EC2-1, but make sure to differentiate the content or server name.

### Step 3: Create Load Balancer (ALB)

1. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the AWS Management Console. Configure the ALB with the following settings:
   - Scheme: Internet facing
   - Select: New Target Group and add both EC2 instances.
   - Listener: HTTP (Port 80)
   - Use the security group created in Step 1 (`ashokit_Security_Group`).

2. Once the Load Balancer is created, a DNS name will be generated. This may take up to 3 minutes.

### Step 4: Test the Load Balancer

1. Send a request to the Load Balancer's DNS URL and observe the response. The load balancer should distribute traffic to both EC2 instances.

### Step 5: Cleanup

After testing, remember to delete the Load Balancer, Target Groups, and EC2 instances to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Note

- Always ensure to delete the Load Balancer and EC2 instances after you are done with your testing to avoid incurring unwanted costs.


## Types of Load Balancers in AWS

AWS offers various types of load balancers to suit different use cases:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Ideal for handling HTTP and HTTPS requests and supports path-based routing. Great for microservices architectures.

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Provides ultra-high performance, handles millions of requests per second, and is suitable for scenarios with static IP addresses.

3. **Gateway Load Balancer:** Designed for applications that use third-party services.

4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Phased out as of August 15, 2022, and replaced by ALB and NLB.

## Microservices Architecture and Load Balancing

In microservices architecture, projects are divided into multiple services, each running as a separate project on separate servers. Load balancing becomes crucial in this scenario to efficiently distribute traffic among the various services.

- Create security groups, EC2 instances, and target groups for each service.
- Configure routing in the load balancer to route requests to the appropriate target group based on URLs or query strings.
- Microservices architecture makes maintenance and scalability easier by isolating functionality and reducing the impact of changes in one service on others.


## Microservices Architecture and Load Balancing

In microservices architecture, projects are divided into multiple services, each running as a separate project on separate servers. Load balancing becomes crucial in this scenario to efficiently distribute traffic among the various services.

- **Create Security Groups, EC2 Instances, and Target Groups:** Set up the necessary components for each microservice. Each microservice will have its own set of resources.

- **Configure Routing:** In a microservices architecture, you must configure the load balancer to route incoming requests to the appropriate target group based on URLs or query strings. This ensures that each microservice gets the traffic intended for it.

- **Isolation and Scalability:** Microservices architecture isolates different functionalities, making it easier to maintain and scale individual services. Changes to one service have minimal impact on others.


## Example: Setting Up EC2 Instances and Application Load Balancer (ALB)

In this example, we'll walk through the steps to set up Amazon EC2 instances and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.
## Microservices Architecture and Load Balancing

In a microservices architecture, different services are divided into separate projects, and each service has its own set of servers. This separation allows for easier maintenance and scaling. To distribute traffic among these services, we use Load Balancers.

Consider a scenario where you have three different projects: Flights, Hotels, and Trains. Each project has multiple servers running to handle user requests. These groups of servers are known as "Target Groups." For example:

- Flights Target Group: Servers for the Flights project
- Hotels Target Group: Servers for the Hotels project
- Trains Target Group: Servers for the Trains project

All these target groups are connected to a Load Balancer. When a user sends a request from the UI, it comes to the Load Balancer. Unlike monolithic architectures where requests are distributed evenly using round-robin, microservices require intelligent routing to direct the request to the appropriate target group.

This is where Load Balancer Routing comes into play. For instance, if a request contains `/flights`, it should be sent to the Flights Target Group, where one of the servers handles it. Similarly, if the request has `/hotels`, it should go to the Hotels Target Group, and so on. This routing is known as Path-Based Routing, and it's supported by Application Load Balancing.

### Setting Up Microservices Environment

To illustrate the setup of a microservices environment with Load Balancing, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create Security Group**: Set up a security group with SSH (Port 22) and HTTP (Port 80) protocols.

2. **Launch EC2 Instances**: Create EC2 instances for each microservice (e.g., Flights and Trains) with appropriate web applications. Ensure that you use user data scripts to configure the instances.

   - Example User Data for Flights (EC2-1):
     ```bash
     #! /bin/bash
     sudo su
     yum install httpd -y
     cd /var/www/html
     echo "<html><h1>Flights Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
     service httpd start
     ```

   - Example User Data for Flights (EC2-2):
     ```bash
     #! /bin/bash
     sudo su
     yum install httpd -y
     cd /var/www/html
     echo "<html><h1>Flights Server - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
     service httpd start
     ```

3. **Create Target Groups**: For each microservice, create a Target Group and add the respective EC2 instances to it.

4. **Configure Load Balancer**: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configure routing rules to route requests based on URLs to the appropriate Target Groups. You can use query strings to differentiate between services.

   - For example, configure a rule to route requests with `?ticket=flight` to the Flights Target Group and `?ticket=train` to the Trains Target Group.

5. **Test the Load Balancer**: Send requests to the Load Balancer's DNS URL and observe the distribution of traffic among the microservices.

6. **Clean Up**: After testing, remember to delete the Target Groups, Load Balancer, and EC2 instances to avoid unnecessary charges.

**Note**: Always clean up resources when you're done with your testing to avoid incurring costs.

By following these steps, you can set up a microservices environment with intelligent routing using Load Balancing, allowing you to efficiently manage multiple projects and their respective servers.



### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have an AWS account and access to the AWS Management Console.

### Step 1: Create Security Groups

Create two security groups with the following inbound rules:

- SSH (Port 22) for remote access.
- HTTP (Port 80) for web traffic.

### Step 2: Launch EC2 Instances

1. Launch two Amazon EC2 instances, each with a user data script to install a web server (e.g., Apache) and host a simple web page.

2. Attach the security groups created in Step 1 to the EC2 instances.

### Step 3: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1. Create an Application Load Balancer in the AWS Management Console, specifying the security group, listeners, and target groups.

2. Configure routing rules in the ALB to route traffic based on URL paths. For example:
   - If the URL path contains `/flight`, route to the "Flights Target Group."
   - If the URL path contains `/train`, route to the "Trains Target Group."

3. Note down the DNS name of your ALB; it will be used to access your application.

### Step 4: Test the Load Balancer

1. Access the DNS name of your ALB to see the load balancer in action.

2. Test different URL paths to confirm that traffic is routed to the appropriate EC2 instances based on the routing rules.

### Step 5: Cleanup

After testing, remember to delete the ALB, target groups, and EC2 instances to avoid unnecessary charges.
