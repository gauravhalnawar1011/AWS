# Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App" Lab! In this session, you'll work with Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to create a relational database instance. The lab focuses on launching an RDS DB instance with high availability, configuring the instance to permit connections from your web server, and interacting with the database through a web application.

## Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab aims to reinforce the concept of leveraging an AWS-managed database instance for relational database needs. After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Launch an Amazon RDS DB instance with high availability.
- Configure the DB instance to permit connections from your web server.
- Open a web application and interact with your database.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes
