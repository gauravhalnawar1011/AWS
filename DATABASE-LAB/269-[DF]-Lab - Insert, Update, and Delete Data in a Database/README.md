# Insert, Update, and Delete Data in a Database Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Insert, Update, and Delete Data in a Database" Lab! In this hands-on session, you will work with a relational database called "world," which contains three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. Your task is to validate the database configuration by running INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements on the "country" table.

## Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab aims to demonstrate your ability to perform essential SQL operations, including:

- Inserting rows into a table.
- Updating rows in a table.
- Deleting rows from a table.
- Importing rows from a database backup file.

Upon completion, you should feel confident in your skills to manipulate and manage data in a relational database.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes

2. Wait until the lab status shows as "ready" before proceeding.

## Task 1: Connect to a Database

In this task, you'll connect to an instance containing a database client, referred to as the Command Host. Follow the AWS Management Console steps to connect to the instance and use the terminal to run MySQL commands.

## Task 2: Insert Data into a Table

This task involves inserting sample data into the "country" table. Verify the initial state of the table, insert two rows, and confirm the successful insertion.

**Challenge:** Insert rows into the "country" table with specified values.

## Task 3: Update Rows in a Table

This task focuses on updating rows in the "country" table. Set values in the "Population" column to 0 for all rows, verify the update, and then update values in multiple columns.

## Task 4: Delete Rows from a Table

Exercise caution in this task as you delete all rows from the "country" table. Verify the deletion afterward.

## Task 5: Import Data using an SQL File

In this task, you'll import sample data into the "country" table using an SQL file. Run commands to load the data and verify the changes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully:

- Inserted rows into a table.
- Updated rows in a table.
- Deleted rows from a table.
- Imported rows from a database backup file.
