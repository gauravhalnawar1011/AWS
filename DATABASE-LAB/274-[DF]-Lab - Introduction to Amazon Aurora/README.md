# Introduction to Amazon Aurora Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the "Introduction to Amazon Aurora" Lab! In this session, you'll get hands-on experience with Amazon Aurora, a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database engine. The lab covers creating an Aurora instance, connecting to a pre-created Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, configuring the EC2 instance to connect to Aurora, and querying the Aurora instance.

## Topics Covered

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create an Aurora instance.
2. Connect to a pre-created Amazon EC2 instance.
3. Configure the Amazon EC2 instance to connect to Aurora.
4. Query the Aurora instance.

**Duration:** Approximately 40 minutes
