# Challenge Lab: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB

## Challenge Description

Welcome to the Challenge Lab: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB! This lab is designed to reinforce the concept of leveraging an AWS-managed database instance for solving relational database needs using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). After completing this challenge, you should be able to:

1. Launch an Amazon RDS DB instance using either Amazon Aurora Provisioned DB or MySQL database engines.
2. Use the Amazon RDS Query Editor to query data.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes

## Challenge Steps

### Step 1: Launch an Amazon RDS DB Instance

1. Launch an Amazon RDS DB instance using either Amazon Aurora Provisioned DB or MySQL database engines.
   - Choose a supported engine: Amazon Aurora or MySQL.
   - Template: Choose Dev/Test or Free tier.
   - Availability and durability: Avoid creating a standby instance.
   - DB instance size: Choose Burstable classes (db.t2 and db.t3 instances) of type db.t*.micro to db.t*.medium.
   - Storage: Choose General Purpose SSD (gp2) of a size up to 100 GB. Provisioned IOPS access is restricted.
   - Amazon VPC: Use the Lab VPC.
   - Security Group: Include a security group that will allow the LinuxServer to connect to the RDS instance.
   - For MySQL, under Additional configuration - Enable Enhanced monitoring - Disable the option.
   - Purchasing Options: On-Demand instances are allowed. Other purchasing options are disabled.
   - Click the "Details" followed by "Show."
   - Download PEM (for Linux or macOS) or Download PPK (for Windows) depending on your local operating system.
   - Make a note of the LinuxServer address.

### Step 2: Connect to LinuxServer and Install MySQL Client

2. Connect (SSH) to the LinuxServer using the details you made a note of.
3. Install a MySQL client and use it to connect to your database. Refer to [MySQL Client documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/) for assistance.

### Step 3: Create Table RESTART and Insert Sample Rows

4. Create a table named RESTART with the following columns:
   - Student ID (Number)
   - Student Name
   - Restart City
   - Graduation Date (Date Time)
   - Capture a screenshot for submission.
5. Insert 10 sample rows into the RESTART table.
   - Capture a screenshot for submission.

### Step 4: Select All Rows from Table RESTART

6. Select all rows from the RESTART table.
   - Capture a screenshot for submission.

### Step 5: Create Table CLOUD_PRACTITIONER and Insert Sample Rows

7. Create a table named CLOUD_PRACTITIONER with the following columns:
   - Student ID (Number)
   - Certification Date (Date Time)
   - Capture a screenshot for submission.
8. Insert 5 sample rows into the CLOUD_PRACTITIONER table.
   - Capture a screenshot for submission.

### Step 6: Select All Rows from Table CLOUD_PRACTITIONER

9. Select all rows from the CLOUD_PRACTITIONER table.
    - Capture a screenshot for submission.

### Step 7: Perform Inner Join and Display Results

10. Perform an inner join between the two tables created above (RESTART and CLOUD_PRACTITIONER).
    - Display Student ID, Student Name, Certification Date.
    - Capture a screenshot for submission.
