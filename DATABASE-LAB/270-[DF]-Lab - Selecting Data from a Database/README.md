# Selecting Data from a Database Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Selecting Data from a Database" Lab! In this hands-on session, you will work with a relational database called "world," which contains three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. Your task is to write SQL queries using the SELECT statement and various operators to extract specific information from the database.

## Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab aims to demonstrate your ability to use the SELECT statement and common database operators, including:

- COUNT() function
- Comparison operators (<, >, =)
- WHERE clause
- ORDER BY clause
- AND operator

Upon completion, you should feel confident in your skills to retrieve data from a relational database based on specific criteria.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes
