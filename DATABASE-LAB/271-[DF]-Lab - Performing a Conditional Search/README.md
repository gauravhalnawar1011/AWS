# Performing a Conditional Search Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Performing a Conditional Search" Lab! In this session, you will work with a relational database named "world" that contains three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. Your task is to write SQL queries using the SELECT statement and a WHERE clause to search for specific records in the country table.

## Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab aims to demonstrate your ability to use the SELECT statement and a WHERE clause to filter records with a conditional search. By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Write a search condition using the WHERE clause
- Utilize the BETWEEN operator
- Employ the LIKE operator with wildcard characters
- Use the AS operator to create a column alias
- Incorporate functions in both the SELECT statement and the WHERE clause

## Task 2: Query the world database

In this task, you will query the "world" database using various SELECT statements and database functions. You'll explore conditions using the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN operator, and the LIKE function. Additionally, you'll use column aliases and functions in both SELECT and WHERE.

**Challenge:** Write a query to return the sum of the surface area and population of North America.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully:

- Used the SELECT statement and a WHERE clause to filter records conditionally.
- Utilized the BETWEEN operator for range conditions.
- Employed the LIKE function with wildcard characters.
- Used the AS operator to create column aliases.
- Incorporated functions in both the SELECT statement and the WHERE clause.
