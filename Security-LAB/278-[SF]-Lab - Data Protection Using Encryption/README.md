# Data Protection Using Encryption

## Lab Summary

Welcome to the "Data Protection Using Encryption" lab! In this hands-on experience, you will explore cryptography and encryption techniques in the context of AWS. Specifically, you will connect to a file server hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance and configure the AWS Encryption Command Line Interface (CLI) to encrypt and decrypt data. The lab focuses on using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for key management and encryption.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes

## Lab Environment

The lab environment includes one preconfigured EC2 instance named "File Server." An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is attached to enable connection to the instance using the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

### Accessing the AWS Management Console

1. Click on "Start Lab" at the upper-right corner of these instructions.
2. Wait for the lab to be ready (indicated by a green circle).
3. Click on the green circle next to AWS at the top to open the AWS Management Console.

### Important Note

- **Do not change the lab Region unless specifically instructed to do so.**
