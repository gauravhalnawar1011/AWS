# Network Hardening Using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager

## Lab Summary

Welcome to the "Network Hardening Using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager" lab! In this lab, you play the role of a new security engineer for AnyCompany. Your task is to identify weak areas in the company's network security and update AnyCompany's environment for better efficiency and optimization. You will utilize Amazon Inspector to perform an agentless network audit on your EC2 instances, analyze the findings, and update security groups. Additionally, you will replace the BastionServer with Systems Manager to enhance security.

**Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes

## Lab Environment

The lab environment includes two EC2 instances: a bastion server named BastionServer in a public subnet and an application server named AppServer in a private subnet.
