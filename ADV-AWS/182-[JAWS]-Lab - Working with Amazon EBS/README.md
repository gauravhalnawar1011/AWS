# Working with Amazon EBS

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a scalable, high-performance block-storage service designed for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). In this lab, you will learn how to create an EBS volume and perform various operations such as attaching it to an instance, creating a file system, and taking a snapshot backup.
